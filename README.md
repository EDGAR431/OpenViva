OpenViva is an open-source continuation of Project Viva, originally made by Sir Hal. It is a VR and non-VR compatible game where you can interact with your very own AI anime character. The game features advanced AI simulation that can interact and respond to many of your actions in a dynamic way through inverse kinematics, complex behaviors, and currently over 200 animations. The character's mood is dynamic and responds to how you treat it, allowing you to play with it, feed it, or just be friends with it.

This repository is our own reimagining of Viva project done with Unreal engine 5. We believe this is a game that should be made and run by the community, for the community which is why it was released under AGPLv3 as to ensure everyone gives back to the community.
